Santa Baby,


I really like cozy, comfy things. My favorite colors are pastel purple or maybe a burnt orange. I have too many blankets and sweaters though because I'm a dumb bitch. I feel bad for listing my interests despite this being my idea. I really just wanted to know other people's interests. Uhhh I love meaningful poetry. Not so much romance and tears. Maybe something a little more on the euphoric side with a bit of heartbreak. Honestly if you found a really comfy oversized sweater I wouldn't complain and probably be overjoyed. Sunflowers and panda bears!! Something unique? Please write me a handwritten card!! I love those. Tell me how much I annoy you. I know I'm annoying, sorry about that. Whoever this is, I really care about you though. Unless you got a B- in discrete. JK hahaha what a funny, original joke.

I hope this was helpful. If not then just remember comfy, cozy and cute. It doesn't even have to be sunflowers or those colors or panda bears. Maybe something I haven't even thought of? I would love that. Definitely write me a letter please.

Lots of love,

Ashley
