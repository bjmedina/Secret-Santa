Dear Santa,

Ive been a pretty good boy (for the most part) this year, and I believe that it is your obligation to get me something that you know I deserve. Being a decent person is not an easy task, especially when one is surrounded with people who make that task difficult; you must reward me for my ability to not murder them.

To make your search for the perfect present as easy (and fun) as possible, I'll tell you a little about myself.

--
- When it comes to me, an Amazon gift-card can never hurt (but theres no fun in getting that and calling it a day).

- I love listening to and discovering different kinds of music. I also really enjoy collecting vinyl, which I have plenty of. My favorite band is Radiohead. You dont necessarily have to get me a Radiohead record; Ill most likely get those myself. Get me something you like! Exercise good judgment, though; if you think I wont like it, and you've asked others and they think the same, dont get it! Check out my spotify for *some of* the things I listen to.

- I love hats. Specifically, I love dad hats from different universities. I have a couple: Harvard, MIT, Tufts, UF, and UCF. Im not really picky, but I just would like them to look like these (notice the font of the "DAD") ( https://bit.ly/2TYFh0W ) ( https://bit.ly/2BGV2m2 ). A SANTA HAT WOULD BE DOPE.

- An ugly sweater or two would be dope. I really like darker colors, so keep that in mind. For sweaters, I wear an X-Large, but I wont mind something BIGGER.

- I really like reading. Mostly books about the brain and books about controversial topics (Im currently reading Lolita by Vladimir Nabokov. That book is fucked.). Books about nerdy shit are my LIFEEEE (like "What if?" by Randall Munroe). I don't really care for science fiction, but ill try it. Two books that I've been wanting to read are "Musicophilia" and "The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat", both by Oliver Sacks.

- Lastly, if all comes to fail, get me something to remember you by! Id really appreciate something that you took time to make/do, regardless of what it is. I am a sap for handwritten, heartfelt letters. If youd like to write me one, go ahead.

You arent restricted to the things I mentioned above. Can be anything you want(just nothing sexual, please). 
Hope this helps, Santa.
Get to work.

P.S, I like Mint Oreos. I fucking LOVE socks. I need more cute/funny ones.
