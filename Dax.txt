What’s up Santa,

Name’s Dax. Video games (PC, not PS4 or Xbox) is probably my main interest. A Steam gift card is probably the safest gift for me (https://bit.ly/2EcpYxQ).

I’ve been playing a lot of Hollow Knight recently, so a poster or t-shirt (for t-shirts, I'm a large) from here (https://bit.ly/2g87Rha) would also be an awesome option, if you want to do something more physical.

Posters, t-shirts or other merch from my other favorite games would also be cool (The Witcher 3, Dark Souls 3, Lethal League Blaze, Warhammer: Vermintide 2, DOOM).

If you want to avoid video games, I also enjoy reading. I’ve been wanting to read the following: Brave New World by Aldous Huxley, Slaughterhouse-Five by Kurt Vonnegut, and Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance by Robert M. Pirsig (no particular order of preference there). A hard copy of any of those would be sweet.

I’ve also wanted to get the 3 Lord of the Rings books, but all 3 probably exceed the $ maximum.

Of course, feel free to use your own judgment, within reason.

Thanks! Looking forward to Friday!
