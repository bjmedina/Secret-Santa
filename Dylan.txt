Hey Santa, 

I'm Dylan and I like video games, most notably the Dark Souls series, anything super popular like Fortnite and COD is fucking trash. I have a narrow taste in music (mostly just sub genres of Rock/Metal), but I like and will sometimes listen to a lot of different shit, except for County, Rap, and Pop. My favorite band is Circa Survive. My shirt size is large. I love Heinz Ketchup.

I'm not super materialistic so I don't really have a specific thing that I want. For this situation something sentimental would be more of an appropriate gift for me. So a little trinket or something that I can keep to look back on this as a memory would be fantastic. If you have trouble finding something that you think is good enough then you can always ask my girlfriend Ashley for some help.

~Dylan
