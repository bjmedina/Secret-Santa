Dear Santa,

My name is Josh. I really like yugioh. It's my favorite card game but i don't really have anybody to play with so i get cards usually to build decks that are non-meta or if they're cute or nice looking cards. Like the last deck I tried to build, before the cards got really expensive, was a fluffal deck because the normal deck monsters are super cute and the extra deck monster are cool looking. So anyways just get me these packs of yugioh cards 
Make sure they're from:
1.) Hidden Summoners
2.) Soul Fusion
Please these packs please because the cards are for the new deck I'm building which are in the hidden summoners pack but the super expensive cards i need to help my deck be good is in soul fusion pack. But if you can only get one of the packs I would like the Hidden Summoners pack one way more than soul fusion pack. Oh also a yugioh card box because i need a new one because I'm making a Prank-kids deck so i need a new box to separate them. Make sure the card box specifically for yugioh cards because there is a difference. Least important item is if you can get yugioh individual card sleeves so i can keep the cards you get me, if they're good, in the best condition possible. If you don't know where to get this stuff the packs are literally at Target or Walmart and for the box and sleeves there's a card shop call coolstuffinc in Waterford it also has the card packs. 

Well thanks Santa,
-Josh
