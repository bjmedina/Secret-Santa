Dear Gift Giver, 

I like cool socks and cool shirts. And cool rings. If you’re at a thrift shop and you see a cool ring you could get that for me. Or anything music related: vinyl (although this is a risk because I have a lot of vinyl and I might already have the one you want to get me), CDs, cassettes, shirts (this has no risk cuz I have like three band shirts), stickers, patches, posters… 

You could get me a gift card lol or a cool book.

Or plants/seeds. I like to garden. But if its a plant preferably a small succulent because I live in a tiny dorm. Get me a pretty one. 


I hope this helps :)
