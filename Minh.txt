Hi, Santa:

I'm a gamer and solely derive pleasure from the art of gaming ðŸ˜Ž 

I'm into Nintendo stuff but I also have a PC so I like steam games as well. Just not those lame normie games like Fork Knife or Call of Dookie. 

All jokes aside, I really like things from Zelda, Fire Emblem, Xenoblade Chronicles, or Pokemon. I'm also into collecting and painting plastic model kits like the Gundam ones you see in Gamestop / Barnes & Noble. I guess Iike anime stuff but pls no big tiddy hentai shit since I'm not a complete degenerate.

I know you're a gamer since you've been playing games on me for the last 19 years of my life, since I haven't gotten anything from you. 

So, from one gamer to another,

Mary Crimmus.
