Hello!

     I stopped believing in Santa long ago, but it was only recently that I realized that the Santa of my youth, was actually an ancient archetype that has existed for as long as humanity. Humanity is comprised of many conflicting egos, ebbing and flowing in influence with the times. Santa, is the ego of human compassion. We desire to do good things for our fellow humanoids because kindness is a fundamental value that builds trust and community, both of which are foundational to a thriving society.
     I participate in this Santa of Secrets, because I believe in the power of ancient archetypes, and because I believe that rituals such as this build community.

So, here is my list, not in any particular order:

1) casual wear (maybe a shirt or some cool socks idk)

2) a gadsden flag sticker (don't tread on me!!!!)

3) blank CD's (to replace my broken mixtape)

4) one of those electronics kitsch (mama needs some new potentiometers! Or maybe something with more attachments for the raspberry pi or arduino idk)

Well, there you have it. I hope this information is great, and I wish you a merry Christmas.
