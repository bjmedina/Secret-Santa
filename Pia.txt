Fuck you Nick Clause,
 
Youre a complete freak for stalking kids, enslaving midgets & abusing the reigndeer that haul you around to “deliver presents”. I know the “naughty” kids are just the ones that dont let you have your way with them. Youre a pervert & a child molester.

Im on to you old man & I have the resources to destroy your reputation. HOWEVER, since I have no morals, I am not above extortion.  My silence can be bought. 

In exchange for not exposing you for being the pervert that you are, I have curated a list of the finest items money can buy. 

-Glasses, the fake kind. I like Potters glasses but I also like big rimmed glasses. 
-Band tees. I like P!ATD but honestly, pick whatever you want. If you pick a band that idk, Im probably just gonna listen to their music so Im not a fraud for owning the shirt. Womens Medium, Mens Small.
- SOCKS. Cool socks. 
- I need a belt that actually fits. The one I stole from my mom is too big. 
- I watch a lot of cartoons. So anything related to shows like that are a safe bet (Rick & Morty, Bojack Horseman, Brickleberry, Paradise PD, Big Mouth, Bobs Burgers etc etc )
- Bryan says I should get a new lightning cable  cause the one in my car works, but is frayed & hes convinced I’m going to electrocute myself & die which I WOULD be fine with, but I dont want him to be right if it does happen so.. 

Yeah. Think thats about it. 

Good luck, Chuck. 

PS.  If you completely procrastinate this I will not be mad if you get me $20 worth of cantaloupe. I like cantaloupe.  

-Pia
